## As a just-in-case + record keeping.
	## NOTE: Main-branch download setup has changed. Only does it when generating solution, no separate download_sdks.exe.
	## Be sure to delete the Code/SDKs folder on the initial git pull or it won't run.
	## After generation the newly downloaded zip files should match any tracked below!
	## Definitely need a better system for custom SDK-related edits tracking. For now, doing git add -f
