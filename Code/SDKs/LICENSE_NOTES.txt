FMOD:
	According to FMOD, you can actually redistribute the required files more or less. Needs a bit more clarification but here's what I got.
	"We allow people to redistribute our dll, just not the whole contents of the FMOD SDK installer. If you can dynamically link to FMODâ€™s dll you should be able to distribute it and not have to include any other files."

	tl;dr I can use it just have to credit them and say if I've made changes! (Which ofc I haven't.)
